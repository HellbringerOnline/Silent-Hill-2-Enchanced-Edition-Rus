 The police announced today that Walter Sullivan, who was arrested on the 18th of this month for the brutal murder of Billy Locane and his sister Miriam, committed suicide in his jail cell early on the morning of the 22nd.
 According to the police statement, Sullivan used a soup spoon to stab himself in the neck, severing his carotid artery.
 By the time the guard discovered him, Sullivan was dead from blood loss, the spoon buried two inches in his neck.

Laura.
Huh? You know my name?
Eddie told me.
That big, fat blabbermouth.
How do you know about Mary?
What's the big deal?
Why can't you just tell me?
You gonna yell at me if I don't?
No... I won't.
I was friends with Mary... We met at the hospital. It was last year...
You liar!! Laura, I...
Fine! Don't believe me!
But last year, Mary was already... I'm sorry, Laura.
Но в прошлом году Мэри уже... Прости, Лора.
This is no place for a kid. There are all sorts of strange things around here... I can't believe you haven't even gotten a scratch on you.
Why should I?
