There's no reason to go back. I'm going to look for Mary....
Незачем возвращаться. Я хочу найти Мэри.....


The road is blocked. I can't go any further this way. I can't make it to the park this way. I'll have to find another way.
Дорога заблокирована. Так до парка не добраться. Придется искать обходной путь.


There's been a cave-in on the road. I can't go any further this way. I can't make it to the park this way. I'll have to find another way.
Дорога обвалилась. Так до парка не добраться. Придется искать обходной путь.


Dead.... Could it have been that creature...? What's going on in this town...?
Мертв.... Убит этим существом...?
Что творится в этом городе...?


Something is written on it.
Too bad I can't read it because the surface has been rubbed away.
Remains of XXXX Swamp
The x meters of land surrounding this monument was originally swamp, but was later filled in.
From long ago, the swamp was nicknamed Blood Swamp because the executioners poured the water used to wash the execution tools in here.
Perhaps it's for that reason that many people claim to have seen ghosts in the area.
Тут что-то написано.
Жаль, не могу прочитать, поверхность стерлась.

I can't escape right now.
It's dangerous to turn my back on this monster.
Сбежать не получится.
Опасно поворачиваться спиной к монстру.



Oh...
Ох...


Is it dead? What the hell is it?
Оно мертво? Что это, черт возьми, такое?


It's not human...
Это не человек...


Oh yeah.
Ах да!


...This thing broken?
...Оно сломано?

What the ...?

I'd better take it anyway. I might need it.
Лучше его забрать. Вдруг пригодится.


I got the apartment gate key.
Я взял ключ от ворот апартаментов.


I used the apartment gate key.
Я использовал ключ от ворот апартаментов.


I'm going to write everything that I've learned so far. Maybe that will help you out somehow. If you're reading this, it probably means I'm already dead.

I saw those demons. They were there, I'm certain. But my friend says he didn't see anything. If that's true, does that mean that what I saw was an illusion?
But whether that demon that ate human beings was real, or whether it was just some kind of hallucination that my mind dreamed up... one thing I know for sure is that I'm beyond all hope.

 It seems that they're attracted to light. That's why people who need light to see are their natural prey. They also react strongly to sound.
 If you want to go on living, you'd be better off just sitting in the dark and staying quiet. But even that probably won't save you.

If you're going to try to fight them, the most important thing is to relax. It's dangerous to fire a gun while you're all crazy with fear.
Take good aim, and then squeeze the trigger. And don't forget to finish them off. I think most of those creatures can be killed, even if they are tougher than people.

Run away.

Run away! Run away! Run away!
Run away! Run away! Run away!
Run away! Run away! Run away!

There's a memo pad on the ground.
Блокнот.


A torn memo page is on the ground.
Вырванная из блокнота страница.


Are these marks... blood!?
Это пятна... крови!?


That shadow just now...
Силуэт...


That shadow just now bothers me. What was that...?
Та фигура беспокоит меня. Что это было...?


The door that wakes in darkness, opening into nightmares.
Дверь, что просыпается во тьме и отворяется в кошмары.



Or perhaps you are a fool. The truth usually betrays people.
A part of that abyss is in the old society.
The key to the society is in the park. At the foot of the praying woman, inside of the ground, inside of a box. To open it, I need a wrench.
My patient buried it there. I knew, but did nothing. It made me uneasy to have such a thing near. I wasn't looking for the truth, I was looking for tranquility.
I also saw that thing. I fled, but the museum was sealed as well. Now no one dares to approach that place.
If you still do not wish to stop, James, I pray to the Lord to have mercy on your eternal soul.

I got a wrench.
Я взял гаечный ключ.
